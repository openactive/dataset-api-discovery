This document specifies a dataset site and embedded JSON-LD document that together describe
an open data dataset and define related APIs that are available to manipulate it.

Contributions to this document are not only welcomed but are actively solicited
and should be made via
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openactive/dataset-api-discovery/issues) and

<div class="note">
  This document represents an early Editors Draft of the planned API design. It is
  likely to change between now and its final version. These
  early drafts are intended to help developers provide that feedback by developing

# Introduction

The document is an output of the
[OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/). As part
of the [OpenActive](https://openactive.io) initiative, the community group is
developing standards that will promote the publication and use of open
[opportunity data](https://openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#categories-of-physical-activity-data)
in helping people to become more physically active.

This specification aims to build on existing work by the [WebAPI Discovery Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/web-api-discovery/) and the [Schema.org discussion](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1423), providing a profile and guidance specifically both for open data publishers and implementers of Web APIs that manipulate openly available datasets. It also aims to provide conformance rules to ensure that implementers include the details necessary to allow <a>Data Consumer</a> to reliably integrate with standards-compliant services without human intervention.

The specification defines the requirements of a <a>Dataset Site</a> provided by a <a>Data Publisher</a> (server) for use by a <a>Data Consumer</a> (client). It includes high level requirements for human-readable content, and detailed requirements and conformance rules for machine-readable content.

## Scope and requirements

<a>Dataset Sites</a> that conform to this specification will be:
- __Schema.org compatible__ - Remain fully compatible with schema.org, and machine-readable by <a>Data Consumers</a> that can read [Schema.org Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset) and future [Schema.org WebAPI](https://schema.org/WebAPI) embedded JSON-LD.
- __Google compatible__ - Use embedded JSON-LD to enable indexing by [Google Dataset Search](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset), and any [future Google `WebAPI` Search](https://blog.apis.guru/api-discovery-can-we-do-better-2336706d5407).
- __DCAT compatible__ - Include DCAT markup to ensure compatibility with the widest range of open data catalogues.
- __Sufficient for automated integration__ - Allow <a>Data Consumer</a>s to reliably integrate with services that are compliant with a standardised [API specification](https://nordicapis.com/difference-api-documentation-specification-definition/) (e.g. a Swagger specification) without requiring additional configuration or human intervention.
- __Human readable__ - Include human-readable content to allow developers to successfully integrate discover, consume and integrate with the <a>Data Publisher's</a> dataset and API.
- __Interactive__ - Include a mechanism for <a>Data Consumers</a> to provide feedback to <a>Data Publishers</a> in the open, and subscribe to updates from <a>Data Publishers</a>.

<a>Dataset Sites</a> will also provide the following information about the implementation of APIs it describes:
- A route to gain access to the Web API described, e.g a website with a sign-up form, or simply a contact e-mail address.
- The specific version of any specification to which the Web API conforms (e.g. the [Open Booking API](https://www.openactive.io/open-booking-api/))
- The specific defined profiles of any specification that are supported, both for any Web APIs defined, but also for any open datasets.
- Where conformance is verified via third-party or self-certification, a statement of the level of conformance, and reference to evidence of this.

Note that although this specification of the [OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/), it is designed to apply to any open dataset where an API is available to manipulate it.

### Functionality that is out of scope

By design this specification will not define some types of functionality.

These have been declared as permanently out of scope because they are
adequately covered by existing specifications:

* __API documentation__ - each system should provide its own documentation, the specification only requires that such documentation exists.
* __API specification and API definition__ - many existing formats are available for API specification (e.g. Swagger, RAML, etc.).

## Audience

The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:

- Software developers who want to publish a <a>Dataset Site</a> ("<a>Data Publishers</a>").
- Software developers building client libraries or tools.
- Software developers writing applications that will use <a>Dataset Sites</a> ("<a>Data Consumers</a>").

# Dataset Site

## Definition

A <dfn>Dataset Site</dfn> is a human and machine readable web page ("<dfn>Dataset Page</dfn>") that describes a dataset and the APIs available to interact with it, with associated functionality that allows for feedback to be provided about the dataset.

## Purpose

The purpose of a <a>Dataset Site</a> is to provide:

* A web page that can be referenced when discussing the dataset.
* A human and machine readable licence associated with the data (the <a>Dataset Page</a> contains invisible metadata which allows its details to be read automatically).
* A human and machine readable rights statement to specify how dataset users (innovators who want to build on top of/use data) should attribute your data.
* An accessible "single point of truth" that explains where the data can be found.
* Details ("documentation") and historical record ("changelog") relating to the format of the data, including the specifications it follows, and the data fields it contains.
* A place where the community can contribute with comments, and raise issues.
* A mechanism by which <a>Data Consumers</a> can subscribe to get updates about changes to the data format, specifications and fields.
* A human and machine readable description of any APIs that can be used to manipulate the data, and the process to gain access to such APIs.
